        name: "Ned's Blackbeans",
        ingredients: '2 TBS olive oil, 1 jalapeno or serrano-seeded and chopped or 1 tsp cayenne, 1 onion-roughly chopped, 2 cloves garlic-chopped, 1 stalk of celery-diced, 1 tsp cinnamon, juice of 1 lime, chopped cilantro, 2 cans black beans',
        steps: "Warm oil in a saute pan over medium heat. Saute onions and hot peppers and celery until soft. While sauteing the vegetables, add salt & pepper to taste, as well as cinnamon.  If you choose to use cayenne instead of fresh peppers, then add some of it now.  After a few minutes of sauteing the vegetables, add the garlic.  Once the vegetables and garlic are cooked you can add the black beans and stir together with the vegetables.  Cook for a few minutes, taste and season as needed with salt, pepper and cayenne.  Gently simmer, covered over a low flame for 15-30 minutes. Stir in lime and cilantro about 10 minutes before you're ready to serve.",

        name: 'Skirt Steak',
        ingredients: '1/4 c kosher salt, 1 c brown sugar, TBS cayenne, TBS garlic powder, TBS ground cinnamon, TBS instant espresso powder, YBS Ancho chili powder, tsp ground black pepper',
        steps: "Make several shallow diagonal slices on both sides of the steak, then massage the spice mixture in to the steak.  Roll the steak(s) up and place in a Ziploc bag and refrigerate for at least 8 hours, but I like to let the meat marinate overnight.  An hour before cooking, take the meat out of the refrigerator and let it come to room temperature.  I cook them on high heat for a few minutes per side depending on thickness.  I usually turn them once I see definitive grill marks. Remember, they'll continue to cook for 10 minutes or so after you take them off the grill, so better to take them off earlier rather than later if you're not sure how done they are.",
